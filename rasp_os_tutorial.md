Then to keep the setting identical on all our 10 robots, we need to clarify some setup

Open ´Edit Setting´ and set the hostname as `raspberrypi5-0x` the `x` here is the unique ID for each robot, e.g. ´raspberrypi5-04´.

Similarly, the Username should be `robot-0x`, and the Password should be `x`, a single number.
