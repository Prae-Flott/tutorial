# Create a map for Create3 with Nav2

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkRVhxYEmGU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkRVhxYEmGU)

To generate a map we could use the [Nav2](https://navigation.ros.org/) package, paired with ROS2

Based on the sensor on Create3 (7 IR Sensor), it is difficult to map the real world, according to an answer from an iRobot staff ([https://discourse.ros.org/t/irobot-create-3-with-nav2/34025/1](https://discourse.ros.org/t/irobot-create-3-with-nav2/34025/1)). 

So, for future steps, we may need a Lidar or an RGB-D camera for mapping the environment for the robot. Please have a look at the [official example](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_examples/tree/galactic/create3_lidar) The odometry sensor on Create 3 can be used to localize the robot.

Through the following tutorial [https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/Autonomy-Science-And-Systems?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/Autonomy-Science-And-Systems?tab=readme-ov-file), we can see some similar ROS2 programming in Turtle3 Robot project.

# Simulator of Create3

iRobot also provides a [Simulator for Create 3](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_sim), which needs to run with the ROS2.
